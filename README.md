I'm a programmer. I studied a higher degree in web application development ðŸ¥µ

As developer you can't miss this [brilliant video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OgIRAjnnJzI), 
if you are Spanish is a must. If you don't saw the video you are not a real developer ðŸ˜±

I love Spring Boot and the Java/Kotlin ecosystem for Back-end development, 
but I'm learning Go as a lightweit alternative and for desktop applications Rust. 
So I'm becoming a Rustacean ðŸ˜Ž

And yes, some people says Desktop applications (or native applications) are diying
but I don't care about because I like native applications over web applications,
they are less accesible than web applications but native are very cool ðŸ¤“
